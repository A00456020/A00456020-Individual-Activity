I have visited Shimla with my family. It is located in Himachal Pradesh, a state of India. The city is beautiful with lots of natural places to visit. I personally liked the Jakhoo Hanuman Temple.
The trip to Shimla is my favourite not only because Shimla is my favourite place, but also because I visited it with my family. The weather in Shimla is really beautiful and you can experience breathing in fresh air from early morning to late night.
